    <p>Nice crispy chicken, with tangy taste. It is best if bone-in chicken pieces used.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1.5 cups cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>2 pounds cut up chicken pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat grill to medium heat.</li>
        <li>In a small skillet combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and put over low heat. Add the poultry seasoning while stirring constantly; when sauce mixes
            well and starts to bubble, it is done.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on hot grill and brush with sauce. Grill for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, and brush chicken with sauce after each turning. 
            Grill until chicken is done and juices run clear. (Note: Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken as it cooks, as it tends to have flair ups due to the oil and
            chicken drippings!)</li>    
    </ol>
